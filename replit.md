## App: CleanTrack

A cleaning company employee app with authentication and two user roles.

### Auth Flow
- Landing page (/) — shows Sign In / Create Account for unauthenticated users
- Sign-up (/sign-up) — custom 2-step: 1) pick role (Boss/Employee), 2) username + email + password
- Sign-in (/sign-in) — Clerk built-in (email/password + Google)
- After sign-up: calls POST /api/users/set-role to store role in Clerk publicMetadata

### Employee View
- Profile: username, "Employee" badge, email, today's assignments with house name, time slot, guest count
- Houses: searchable property grid, click for detail modal with editable notes
- Map: interactive map with house pins

### Boss View  
- Profile: username, "Boss" badge, full employee list, click employee to assign houses for the day (house, date, time slot, guest count)
- Also sees all today's assignments in a dashboard
- Houses: same as employee + editable notes
- Map: same as employee
